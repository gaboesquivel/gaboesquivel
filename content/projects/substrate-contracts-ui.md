# Substrate Contracts UI

Substrate Contracts UI is a key developer tool maintained by Parity Technologies (founded by Ethereum co-founder Dr. Gavin Wood) for the Polkadot ecosystem, which has a market cap exceeding $7B. The UI simplifies WASM smart contract deployment and interaction on Substrate-based blockchains used by dozens of major projects.
 I contributed to the project by enhancing code quality through multiple open-source contributions and gained experience in building dApps with Substrate.
