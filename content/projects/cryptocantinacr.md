story:
  - CryptoCantinaCR started as a recurring after-office happy hour event that brought together blockchain, cryptography, and cryptocurrency enthusiasts in Costa Rica. What began as informal Thursday meetups at Central Pub in Paseo Colón has since evolved into a formal educational initiative under CriptoCantina.org.
  - The events were designed to be casual and inclusive, with no presentations or formal talks, focusing on organic connections and discussions. This format created a space where participants could engage in meaningful conversations about blockchain technology.
  - The initiative later evolved into CriptoCantina.org, a more structured educational platform led by Karla Córdoba. This organization now focuses on formal blockchain education, entrepreneur support, and helping newcomers enter the technology sector.
