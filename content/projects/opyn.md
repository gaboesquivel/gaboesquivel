achievements:
  - Built trading interface with Next.js 14 and React Server Components
  - Set up Ponder indexing service with PostgreSQL for chain data
  - Integrated viem/wagmi for Arbitrum Testnet interactions
  - Implemented type-safe data validation and state management
story:
  - At Opyn, I built their trading interface with Next.js 14 and React Server Components. The frontend used shadcn/ui components based on Radix UI primitives with Tailwind CSS styling.
  - I implemented Ponder for blockchain data indexing, storing data in PostgreSQL via Supabase. Chain interactions were handled through viem/wagmi with Alchemy RPC endpoints.
  - The implementation prioritized type safety using Zod for schema validation, TanStack Query for data management, and nuqs for URL state handling.

# Opyn

Opyn is a decentralized options protocol on Arbitrum that raised $6.7M Series A funding led by Paradigm. Their main product Squeeth is a notable DeFi-native derivative. I implemented their initial trading interface and data indexing setup for Arbitrum Testnet using Next.js, Ponder, and viem/wagmi.
