story:
  - EARTH University offers education in agricultural sciences. I was responsible for building their main website, blog, and newsletter. My work involved creating a digital platform for information dissemination and community engagement, focusing on usability and content management.
  - I implemented a content management system for efficient website updates and maintenance. This system allowed the university staff to manage their online presence without requiring technical expertise for routine content changes.
  - The project included a responsive blog for community engagement and newsletter functionality for stakeholder communication. This work was completed while at IntergraphiDesign, my first job at a development shop, and applied web technologies to support an educational institution.
