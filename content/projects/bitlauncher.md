achievements:
  - Architected a full-stack solution using Viem, Wagmi, Alchemy, Trigger.dev, Supabase, Next.js 14, and ShadcnUI to ensure a scalable and responsive platform.
  - Crafted a custom token bridge for swapping USDT, USDC, and BITUSD to USDCred tokens, facilitating seamless bidding within the platform.
  - Implemented a transaction data indexing system with Supabase for efficient querying, real-time subscriptions, and data aggregation analytics.
  - Deployed Gnosis auction Solidity contracts to EOS EVM and developed a bidding interface with real-time updates via Supabase subscriptions.
  - Created a wallet interface that displays real-time EVM balances through Wagmi token balance subscriptions and EOS token balances via RPC polling.
  - Built a custom indexer for EOS EVM using Node.js, Viem EVM event subscriptions, and dFuse stream for EOS.
  - Developed the chatbot assistant at bitlauncher.ai, leveraging tools integration for accessing the latest news and YouTube videos, and RAG for detailed info retrieval.
  - Integrated AI SDK for internationalization automation and established an AI-driven development workflow using v0.dev, Anthropic Claude Sonnet, Cursor IDE, and SourceryAI.
story:
  - BitLauncher is an AI and crypto launchpad platform providing access to AI startups through token sales and auctions. The platform uses a decentralized approach to make the investment process more accessible to participants.
  - The batch auction system creates a transparent environment for token sales, distributing tokens at a uniform price to reduce barriers in fundraising. I implemented Viem, Wagmi, and Supabase to build a responsive user interface and data layer.
  - I developed this project with the team behind bitcash.org, with whom I've been working since 2020. The platform facilitates token sales using blockchain technology while maintaining a focus on accessibility.
