story:
  - BitcashBank is a platform for cryptocurrency transactions including buying, trading, depositing, and earning. My initial role involved designing the infrastructure, recruiting technical talent, and training developers to build a solid foundation.
  - As the project progressed, I moved to a consulting role to guide its development. I helped build and optimize BitcashDAO for community-based governance, making the platform more responsive to user requirements.
  - I developed chaingraph.io for real-time data updates and implemented WebAuthn integration with the EOSIO blockchain to create a 'walletless' experience. This implementation allowed for a progressive web app approach that improved security while avoiding app store constraints.
