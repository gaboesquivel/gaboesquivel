story:
  - dBoard is a DAO decision-making and community management tool that allows stakeholders to strategize, debate, and vote on organizational actions. I oversaw the technical architecture and led smart contract development and integration.
  - The implementation uses Antelope blockchain and Next.js to create a decentralized governance platform. The smart contracts provide secure and transparent community voting mechanisms to enhance trust among participants.
  - I built a GraphQL API to improve data access and analysis for stakeholders. The project focuses on providing practical tools for DAOs to operate more efficiently and make collective decisions.
