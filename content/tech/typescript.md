intro:
  - TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static type definitions, enhancing code quality, maintainability and developer productivity.
  - It provides compile-time error checking, improved IDE support with autocompletion, and better documentation through explicit type declarations.
experience:
  - Implemented TypeScript across all major projects including LegalAgent, Opyn, BasilicEVM, and BitLauncher for type safety and maintainability.
  - Developed strict typing standards for EVM blockchain interactions in BasilicEVM, ensuring predictable smart contract interactions.
  - Applied TypeScript for RAG architecture implementation in LegalAgent, creating robust data structures for context-aware AI responses.
  - Utilized TypeScript with TanStack libraries to create type-safe data fetching, form validation, and state management patterns.
