intro:
  - Solidity is a statically-typed, contract-oriented programming language for implementing smart contracts on Ethereum and EVM-compatible blockchains.
  - It features contract inheritance, libraries, user-defined types, and event emissions with security practices like access controls and gas optimization.
experience:
  - Implemented Gnosis auction Solidity contracts for BitLauncher on EOS EVM, enabling transparent batch auctions with uniform pricing.
  - Developed type-safe smart contracts for Opyn's decentralized options protocol on Arbitrum Testnet using Solidity and Foundry.
  - Created secure token contracts for Knowledge.io's successful ICO in 2018, focusing on security best practices.
  - Built BasilicEVM's core contract templates and integration patterns to streamline EVM application development.
  - Designed and implemented NFT contracts for RareMint, enabling fractional ownership of authenticated sports collectibles on Polygon.
