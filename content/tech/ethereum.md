intro:
  - Ethereum is a decentralized platform that enables developers to build and deploy smart contracts and decentralized applications.
  - It is widely used for its flexibility and support for a wide range of decentralized applications.
experience:
  - Utilized Ethereum and the EVM in projects like Knowledge.io, RareMint, Opyn, and BitLauncher for building decentralized applications and smart contracts.
  - Developed BasilicEVM, a performance-optimized development stack specifically for EVM applications with smart contracts and chain integration.
  - Implemented Gnosis auction Solidity contracts on EOS EVM for BitLauncher, creating a cross-chain auction platform.
  - Built custom EVM event indexers using Node.js and Viem for capturing real-time blockchain data.
  - Created wallet interfaces showing real-time EVM balances through token balance subscriptions.
